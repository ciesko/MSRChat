    "about": "I am the Principal Architect leading software engineering efforts on the <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/01/04/microsoft-adaptive-biotechnologies-announce-partnership-using-ai-decode-immune-system-diagnose-treat-disease/\">Immunomics</a>\u00a0team in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2017/02/16/microsoft-partners-combine-cloud-ai-research-industry-expertise-focus-transforming-health-care/\">Healthcare Research</a>\u00a0group at Microsoft. In partnership with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/\">Adaptive Biotechnologies</a>, our goal is to create a universal blood test that reads a person\u2019s immune system, to detect a wide variety of diseases including infections, cancers, and autoimmune disorders in their earliest stage, when they can be most effectively diagnosed and treated. The basis of this project is learning the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/TCR-ANTIGEN-MAP\">T-cell Antigen Map</a>: that is, learning the mapping from a T-cell receptor sequence to the antigen(s) it targets.\r\n\r\nMy current efforts center around building systems to enable rapid and reliable machine learning exploration among our core team, key contributing researchers, and various partners. Generally, I aim to abstract the mechanics of data manipulation, code quality, and compute management to allow machine learning experts to focus on innovation.\r\n\r\nPrior to joining Microsoft Research, I lead a team at Spotify building tools to help product owners and data scientists more quickly generate novel hypotheses for user behavior and construct causality experiments. This work was an extension of techniques developed at Preact, a technology company that I co-founded, which was acquired by Spotify for internal use.",
