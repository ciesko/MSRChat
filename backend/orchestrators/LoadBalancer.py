        # The algorithm for selecting an endpoint is as follows:
        #
        # 1. Get the context for each endpoint, which includes a "weight" for the endpoint. 
        #    The weight is the TPM of the endpoint divided by 1000. (For example 80,000 TPM is listed as 80 for the weight.)
        #
        # 2. Calculate the total weight of all endpoints. In this case, we have 80, 80, and 10 for the endpoint weights in the .env file.
        #
        # 3. Calculate the relative weight of each endpoint as a percentage of the total:
        #    endpoint weight / total weight and round to 2 decimal places. 
        #    In this case, we will have [(80 / 170), (80 / 170), (10 / 170)] = [0.47, 0.47, 0.06]
        #
        # 4. Calculate the cumulative weight of each endpoint by adding the relative weights in order. 
        #    Each number in the list is a sum of the preceding numbers.
        #    [0.47, 0.47, 0.06] --> [0.47, (0.47 + 0.47 = 0.94), (0.94 + 0.06 = 1.00)] = [0.47, 0.94, 1.00]
        #
        # 5. Generate a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.
        #
        # 6. a) If the random number is less than or equal to the first cumulative weight, select the first endpoint.
        #    b) Then, if that check fails, check if the random number is less than or equal to the second cumulative weight. 
        #       If that check passes, select the second endpoint.
        #    c) Then, if that check fails, check if the random number is less than or equal to the third cumulative weight.
        #       Since the random number generator has to be between 0 and 1, the third endpoint would be selected.
        #    
        #    For example, in this case if the random number is 0.5, then the first check fails, the second check passes,
        #    and the third check is not executed. The second endpoint is selected.
        #
        #    For a large distribution of calls, the number of calls to each endpoint should be roughly 
        #    proportional to the relative weight percentages. Each generation of a random number is independent of the others,
        #    so the distribution of calls to each endpoint will vary over time.
